This toolkit provides a set of components and utilities for developers to add an augmented experience to their website. For example, a primary use-case supported is the ability to detect barcodes (in -- say -- a real-world store) with the user's device camera, and to show them extended information on a given product.

Please see our [Getting Started](https://perceptiontoolkit.dev/getting-started/) guide.

## Installation

Please check out our [Getting Started](https://perceptiontoolkit.dev/getting-started/) guide for far more information.

Briefly, however: we recommend installation via [npm](https://npmjs.com). Simply:

```
npm install --save perception-toolkit
```

A few starting samples are under [demo](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/perception-toolkit/tree/master/demo), where you can see how to set up barcode detection and the display of values to the end user. The most basic is [demo/simple](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/perception-toolkit/tree/master/demo/simple), and this may be a good starting point in your own project. Once you copy [demo/simple/index.html](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/perception-toolkit/blob/master/demo/simple/index.html) into your own project, you'll need a few small modifications to refer to the Web Perception Toolkit installed in `node_modules` (and assuming that `node_modules` is available at the root of your server, as it is with our sample server):

* You must specify `root` in the existing `window.PerceptionToolkit.config`:

  ```
  window.PerceptionToolkit.config = {
    root: '/node_modules/perception-toolkit',
    
    ...
  }
  ```

* You must change the location of `bootstrap.js` (included at the end of
  `<body>`):
  
  ```
  <script src="/node_modules/perception-toolkit/lib/bundled/bootstrap.js"></script>
  ```
